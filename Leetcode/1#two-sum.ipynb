    "## Description\n",
    "Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\n",
    "Output: [0,1]\n",
    "Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6\n",
    "Output: [1,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6\n",
    "Output: [0,1]\n",

    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "2 <= nums.length <= 104\n",
    "\n",
    "-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\n",
    "\n",
    "-109 <= target <= 109\n",

    "## UMPIRE Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Understand**\n",
    "> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.\n",
    "> - Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.\n",
    "> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can the nums array be empty?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are the numbers guaranteed to have exactly one solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can elements be used more than once?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there any constraints on the array, such as being sorted?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Will the numbers in the array repeat?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 2. **Match**\n",
    "> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since we need to return indices, sorting the array would not help;\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we need to find out whether an element is present in a colection, considering a HashMap (dictionary in Python), where each value is paired with its corresponding index.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 3. **Plan**\n",
    "> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode\n",
    "> - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "General Idea: Create a hashmap to store each element and its index in the nums array so that we can refer to the index once we find the counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a hashmap\n",
    "2. Iterate through the array\n",
    "    - For each number, calsulate its complement (target - current number);\n",
    "    - If the complement exits in the hashmap, then return the indecies of the complement and the current number;\n",
    "    - Otherwise, store the current number and its index.\n",
    "3. The problem guarantees there's only one solution so we can return as soon as we find the match \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 4. **Implement**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python implementation\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n",
    "        records = dict()\n",
    "        for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n",
    "            complement = target - num\n",
    "            if complement in records:\n",
    "                return [records[complement], index]\n",
    "            records[num] = index\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 5. **Review**\n",
    "> - Re-check the algorithm by running through important examples.\n",
    "> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 6. **Evaluate**\n",
    "> **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once, and each lookup in the hashmap is O(1).\n",
    "> **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the array. In the worst case, we store all the elements in the hashmap.\n"
